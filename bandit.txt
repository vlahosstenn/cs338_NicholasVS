Level 0 start with ssh -p 2220 banditN@bandit.labs.overthewire.org

Level 0 -> Level 1 

Solution: use the command "cat readme" to read the readme file, which contains the password: ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If

Summary of lessons: ls shows directory contents and from there you can open specific files in the unix command line with cat and the file name 


Level 1 -> Level 2

Solution: use the command "cat ./-" to read the - file, which contains the password: 263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx
I did use the google search linked on the bandit "helpful reading materials" page which explained why this works

Summary of lessons: Some files can be named with special characters that mean something else when written in the unix command line. To access these files, 
you need to list the entire path to the file, starting with ./


Level 2 -> Level 3

Solution: use the command "cat ./"--spaces in this filename--"" to read the titular file, which contains the password: MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx

Summary of lessons: Wrapping a file name in quotes allows the command line to ignore any special characters within it 


Level 3 -> Level 4

Solution: Use either "find" or "ls -a" to find the name of the hidden file "...Hidden-From-You" and open it with cat to get password: 2WmrDFRmJIq3IPxneAaMGhap0pFhF3NJ

Summary of lessons: some files can be hidden, and not show up with a regular old ls. To find their names, use find or ls -a

Level 4 -> Level 5

Solution: I won't lie I just tried catting all 10 files in the folder, until I found the one that contained a password instead of gibberish, 
which was "-file06" with the password: 4oQYVPkxZOOEOO5pTW81FB8j8lxXGUQw

Summary of lessons: Not all files contain data legible to a human; if the output looks weird it's probably not legible.
